            <head id="a2">BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF GOVERNOR WILLIS A. GORMAN</head>
            <p>Willis Arnold Gorman was born in Kentucky on January 12, 1816. His early career was
        as a lawyer and state legislator (Democrat) in Indiana. During the Mexican War he raised and
        commanded an Indiana rifle battalion and an infantry regiment, and subsequently was elected
        to two terms in the U.S. Congress. President Franklin Pierce appointed him Governor of
        Minnesota in May 13, 1853, and he served in that office until 1857. He was subsequently a
        delegate to the state constitutional convention (1857) and was elected to the first state
        legislature (1858).</p>
            <p>At the outset of the Civil War he commanded the First Minnesota Infantry Volunteers
        (April-October, 1861) until his promotion to brigadier general. Following his discharge from
        military service in 1864, he practiced law in St. Paul in partnership with Cushman K. Davis.
        In 1869 he was appointed St. Paul city attorney, and held that office until his death on May
        20, 1876.</p>

            <head id="a3">SCOPE AND CONTENTS OF THE RECORDS</head>
            <p>Subject files and correspondence of territorial governor Gorman. A large proportion
        relate to territorial officers' appointments and commissions. Letters received and sent
        address the following topics: concerns of federal civilian agencies, military and Indian
        affairs in general, the 1855 treaty with the Winnebago Indians, land sales, the Minnesota
        and Northwestern Railroad Company, and other territorial affairs. Also present are a
        legislative diary (Jan. 27-March 6, 1857), pardon records, petitions regarding local
        government organization, reports from territorial officers, and requests from other states
        for return of fugitives.</p>
            <p>Gorman's governorship spanned a period of both tangible and speculative growth in
        the state's infrastructure and economy, with numerous railroads, educational institutions,
        and corporations being chartered, new counties established, new towns incorporated, and
        several Indian treaties ratified. The surviving records contain only sketchy information on
        these developments, and do not appear to contain any significant documentation on an
        abortive 1857 scheme to remove the state capital from St. Paul to St. Peter.</p>

        with the Winnebago; it is signed by many of the Winnebago signatories to that treaty.
